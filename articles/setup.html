  <h2>Router setup</h2>
  <p>
    Generally speaking, the main trick to enable client side routing is
    to configure the server side router to serve content
    whenever the request gets a <code>404</code> HTTP status code.
    On <em>GitHub Pages</em>, you can achieve this by creating a <code>404.html</code> file.

  <p>
    It is not required that both files have the same content but
    you can start simply coping your <em>index.html</em> into a <em>404.html</em> file.

  <p>
    Of course you need also to enable <em>GitHub Pages</em> in your repository settings.
    You will notice there are two kinds of static websites you can create.
