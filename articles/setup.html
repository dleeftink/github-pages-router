  <h2>Router setup</h2>
  <p>
    Generally speaking, the main trick to enable client side routing is
    to configure the server side router to serve content
    whenever the request gets a <code>404</code> HTTP status code.
    On <em>GitHub Pages</em>, you can achieve this by creating a <code>404.html</code> file.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not required that both files have the same content but
    you can start simply coping your <em>index.html</em> into a <em>404.html</em> file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course you need also to enable <em>GitHub Pages</em> in your repository settings.
    You will notice there are two kinds of static websites you can create.
  </p>

  <h3>First kind</h3>

  <p>
    The first kind happens when your repository has a name like
    <!--<code>YOUR-ACCOUNT-OR-ORGANIZATION.github.io</code>.-->
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case the homepage will be
    <code>https://YOUR-DOMAIN/</code>
    <br>
    where
    <code>YOUR-DOMAIN</code>
    will default to
    <!--<code>YOUR-ACCOUNT-OR-ORGANIZATION.github.io</code>.-->
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also set your <strong>custom domain</strong>, check out the
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">official GitHub Pages documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Second kind</h3>

  <p>
    The second kind is a website that will have an homepage like
    <!--<code>https://YOUR-DOMAIN/YOUR-REPO-NAME/</code>.-->
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case it is required that you add a <code>base</code> tag in your HTML <code>head</code>,
    something like the following:
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;base href="/YOUR-REPO-NAME/" /&gt;</code></pre>
